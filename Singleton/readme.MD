# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only **one instance** and provides a global point of access to it. This is helpful when a single object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The singleton pattern is commonly used in scenarios like logging, configuration management, and database connections.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single Instance:** Only one instance of the class is created throughout the application's lifecycle.
- **Global Access Point:** Provides a globally accessible instance.
- **Thread Safety:** Thread-safe initialization ensures the singleton instance is initialized correctly even in a multi-threaded environment.

## Benefits of Singleton

- **Controlled Access:** Singleton ensures that there is a global and controlled access point to a single instance.
- **Lazy Initialization (Optional):** The Singleton instance can be created only when it's needed, conserving resources.
- **Thread-Safety (with proper implementation):** In multi-threaded environments, Singleton ensures only one instance is created using proper synchronization.

## Example of Singleton in Java

Hereâ€™s an example of a thread-safe Singleton implementation in Java with lazy initialization:

```java
package Singleton;
// vansh chopra - Design Patters - Singleton Pattern

public class Singleton {
   private static volatile Singleton instance;
   private final String data;

   // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
   private Singleton(String data) {
      this.data = data; // All our data is stored in this variable
   }

   // Get the Singleton instance, initializing it if necessary
   public static Singleton getInstanceOrInitialize(String data) {
      Singleton result = instance;
      if (result == null) {
         synchronized (Singleton.class) { // Thread-safe initialization
            result = instance;
            if (result == null) {
               instance = result = new Singleton(data);
            }
         }
      }
      return result;
   }

   // Overloaded method to get the instance without re-initialization
   public static Singleton getInstance() {
      Singleton result = instance;
      if (result == null) {
         throw new IllegalStateException("Singleton is not initialized. Call getInstanceOrInitialize first.");
      }
      return result;
   }

   public String getData() {
      return data;
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Demonstrating Singleton in a multi-threaded environment

      // Task for each thread to initialize or get the Singleton instance
      Runnable task = () -> {
         Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstanceOrInitialize("My Singleton Data from Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + Math.random());
         System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + singleton.getData());
      };

      // Creating and starting 30 threads
      Thread[] threads = new Thread[30];
      for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
         threads[i] = new Thread(task);
         threads[i].start();
      }

      // Waiting for all threads to finish
      for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
         try {
            threads[i].join();
         } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
         }
      }

      // After all threads complete, retrieving and printing the Singleton instance data
      Singleton finalInstance = Singleton.getInstance();
      System.out.println("Final Singleton data: " + finalInstance.getData());
   }
}
```

### Explanation of the Example

- **Private Constructor:** The constructor is private to prevent instantiation of the class from outside.
- **Volatile Instance Variable:** The `instance` variable is marked `volatile` to ensure changes made by one thread are visible to others.
- **Thread-Safe Lazy Initialization:** 
  - The `getInstanceOrInitialize()` method uses **double-checked locking** to ensure thread-safe initialization. If the `instance` is `null`, the method synchronizes and checks again before initializing it.
- **Thread Execution:**
  - The code creates 30 threads, each attempting to initialize the Singleton. Thanks to thread-safety measures, only the first thread initializes the instance, while others reuse the same instance.
- **`IllegalStateException`:** If `getInstance()` is called before `getInstanceOrInitialize()`, it throws an exception, ensuring that the Singleton must be initialized before access.

### Output of the Example

The output will show that all threads get the same Singleton instance, and the final instance is printed with its data, confirming only one instance exists.

Thread 0: My Singleton Data from Thread 0.574623274813
Thread 1: My Singleton Data from Thread 0.574623274813
Thread 2: My Singleton Data from Thread 0.574623274813
...
Final Singleton data: My Singleton Data from Thread 0.574623274813
```

## When to Use Singleton Pattern

- **Configuration Management:** When you need a single shared configuration throughout your application.
- **Logging:** A single logger instance can be used across the system.
- **Database Connections:** To ensure only one connection pool is active at any time.
- **Caching:** For shared access to data across the application.

## Pros and Cons of Singleton

### Pros:
- **Controlled Access to Instance:** Only one instance exists, which is globally accessible.
- **Memory Efficient:** Reduces memory overhead by reusing the same object.
- **Global State Sharing:** Useful for global settings like logging, configurations, etc.

### Cons:
- **Global State:** The Singleton pattern introduces global state, making it harder to manage dependencies and making unit testing more challenging.
- **Thread-Safety Concerns:** Improper synchronization can lead to race conditions in multi-threaded applications.
- **Scalability Issues:** Can introduce bottlenecks as all clients access the same instance.

## Conclusion

The Singleton pattern is powerful when used in scenarios where exactly one instance of a class is required. However, care should be taken to handle thread-safety in multi-threaded applications, and Singleton should be used cautiously to avoid introducing hidden dependencies.
